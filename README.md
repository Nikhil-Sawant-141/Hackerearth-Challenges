This repository contains my code for the Hackerearth Challenges i have participated in so far. Hackearth is a platform for coders to practice coding and compete to improve our skills. 
I being a Data Science Enthusiast participate in Machine learning and Deep learning Challenges to learn new things from community. 
These challenges are designed to help you boost your Machine Learning skills by competing and learning from fellow participants.
Also it is a good way to get hands-on experience in Machine Learning problems and coming up with your own approach to your problem.
